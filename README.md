## Hello ðŸ‘‹
<img src="https://log-collector.30degrees2.workers.dev/hello.png"/></a>
I'm Dito from Jakarta, Indonesia. I currently work as a backend developer & server engineer.

I also lead the integration team, working with external partners to integrate our/their services.

## My Work Experiences!
```
- Integrated Indonesia's unified QR payment system (QRIS) with leading acquirers from sandbox stage, validation testing with regulator, and production deployment.

- Integrated Visa/Mastercard card payment system, with both domestic & international acquirers

- Implemented a high-availability queue system for internal payment products, enabling fast, near-instant processing while preserving transaction data during system failures.

- Manage server deployment from physical colocation -> bare metals -> networking -> virtualization -> kubernetes.

and much more.
```


Other than that, I love travelling.

I'm open to talk!
