## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dito from Jakarta, Indonesia. I currently work as a backend(+server) engineer at a foreign company in Indonesia, serving 50k monthly active users.

Most of the days, I manage server infrastructure from networking -> servers -> kubernetes, followed by backend development mostly using nodejs/typescript.

I also lead the integration team, working with external partners to integrate our services.

Other than that, I love travelling.

I'm open to talk!
