## Hello ðŸ‘‹
<img src="https://log-collector.30degrees2.workers.dev/hello.png"/></a>
I'm Dito from Jakarta, Indonesia. I currently work as a backend developer & server engineer at a foreign company in Indonesia.

I manage server infrastructure from physical colocation -> bare metals -> networking -> virtualization -> kubernetes, followed by backend development mostly using nodejs/typescript.

I also lead the integration team, working with external partners to integrate our services.

Other than that, I love travelling.

I'm open to talk!
